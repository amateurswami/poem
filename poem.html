  <p>Play the one about the family of the ducks<br>
where the ducks go down to the river<br>
and one of them thinks the water will be cold<br>
but then they jump in anyway<br>
and like it and splash around.</p>
	<p>No, I must play the one<br>
about the nervous man from Palestine in row 14<br>
with a brown bag in his lap<br>
in which a gun is hidden in a sandwich.</p>
	<p>Play the one about the handsome man and woman<br>
standing on the steps of her apartment<br>
and how the darkness and her perfume and the beating of their hearts<br>
conjoin to make them feel<br>
like leaping from the edge of chance—</p>
	<p>No, I should play the one about<br>
the hard rectangle of the credit card<br>
hidden in the man’s back pocket<br>
and how the woman spent an hour<br>
plucking out her brows, and how her perfume<br>
was made from the destruction of a hundred flowers.</p>
  <p>Then play the one about the flower industry<br>
in which the migrant workers curse their own infected hands<br>
from tossing sheaves of roses and carnations<br>
into the back of the refrigerated trucks.</p>
	<p>No, I must play the one about the single yellow daffodil<br>
standing on my kitchen table<br>
whose cut stem draws the water upwards<br>
so the plant is flushed with the conviction</p>
    <p>that the water has been sent<br>
to find and raise it up<br>
from somewhere so deep inside the earth<br>
not even flowers can remember.</p>
